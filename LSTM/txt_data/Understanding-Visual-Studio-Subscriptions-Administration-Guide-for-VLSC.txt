Introduction  
This guide was created to help Visual Studio administrators better manage and 
understand their Visual Studio Standard subscriptions (formerly known as MSDN 
Subscriptions ). It describes the Visual Studio administrator roles and responsibilities , 
and provides tools and information to help fulfill them.  
A Visual Studio  administrator has four primary responsibilities:  
1. Understand the benefits and limitations of Visual Studio Standard  
subscriptions . Correctly understanding your benefits can enable y ou to 
eliminate hardware costs by using cloud services, and reduce software costs 
with per -user licenses for pre -production environments.  
2. Assign Visual Studio  subscriptions to specific, named individuals . Your 
contract requires that Visual Studio s ubscriptions be assigned to specific 
individuals. Use the Volume Licensing Services Center (VLSC) website to 
manage users and provide them with access to their subscription benefits.  
3. Accurately inventory your pre -production environment . This is essential t o 
ensur e that all users who interact with Visual Studio -licensed software have 
appropriate license s with their own Visual Studio Standard s ubscription . 
4. Track user assignment changes and acquire additional licenses on 
schedule . Microsoft Volume Licensing Ag reements give you flexibility in how 
you use and assign Visual Studio Standard s ubscriptions . In return, you are 
expected to track changes to software usage and user assignments and process 
orders for additional users on the schedule outlined in their agre ement.  
If you have questions or need help, please contact Microsoft Volume L icensing 
support  for assistance.  
 
Benefits and limitations  
Visual Studio Standard s ubscriptions (formerly MSDN Subscriptions) allow 
development team members to install and use software to design, develop, test, 
evaluate, and demonstrate other software. Visual Studio software is not licensed for 
production environments.  
The following table provides d etail on when Visual Studio Standard s ubscriptions 
may be used:  
Use Guidance  
User -based  licensing  MSDN OS, MSDN platforms, and all levels of 
Visual Studio with MSDN are licensed on a per -
user basis. Each development team member that 
will interact (install, configure, or access) with the 
software included with these products requires 
their own Visual Studio  subscripti on.  
  4   |   Understanding Visual Studio Standard subscriptions ( MSDN Subscriptions ) 
Unlimited  installations  Each licensed user may install and use the 
software on any number of devices to design, 
develop, test, evaluate, and demonstrate software.  
The exception is Microsoft Office, which is licensed 
for one desktop. Visual Studio -licensed software 
can be installed and used at work, home, school, 
and on devices at a customer’s office or on 
dedicated hardware hosted by a third party.  
Production  environments  Visual Studio  software is not licensed for 
production environments, including a ny 
environment accessed by end users for more than 
acceptance testing or feedback, an environment 
connecting to a production database, supporting 
disaster recovery or production backup, or used 
for production during peak periods of activity.  
Exceptions to  this include specific benefits  for 
subscription levels, outlined on the  Visual Studio 
subscriptions website .  
License  reassignment  When a user leaves a team and no longer requires 
a license, you may reassign the license if 90 days 
have passed  since the time of the original 
assignment . 
End user exception  At the end of a software development project, 
users typi cally review an application and, through 
user acceptance testing (UAT)  determine whether 
it meets the criteria for release .  
Team members such as a business sponsor or a 
product m anager can act as proxies for end users. 
End users who do not have a  Visual Studio 
subscription may access the software for UAT if 
use of the software otherwise complies with all 
Visual Studio  licensing terms. It is rare that 
someone whose primary role is designing, 
developing, or testing the software would also 
qualify as an “end user.”  
 
Inventory your pre -production 
environment  
Visual Studio Standard subscriptions (formerly known as MSDN Subscriptions)  
simplify asset management by counting users rather than devices.  
NOTE: Visual Studio  administrators must assign Visual S tudio s ubscriptions to 
specific, named individuals. Naming conventions such as Dev1 or Dev2  are not 
allowed.  
Here are some ways to simplify the process of inventorying your pre -production 
environment:  
   
  5   |   Understanding Visual Studio Standard subscriptions ( MSDN Subscriptions ) 
 Review your user assignments . The Microsoft MSDN Subscription  
Administration  Portal help s you track  Visual Studio Standard s ubscription  
(formerly MSDN Subscription)  assignments. This p ortal is within the VLSC. 
This guide will show you ho w to access it.  
 Use Active Directory to list users . If you use Active Directory to manage 
user access, you may be able to identify development and test users by their 
directory membership.  
 Use automated  tools to inventory systems . You may also need to use a 
software inventory tool to help manage your software assets and distinguish 
pre-production environments from production ones. Customers using 
Microsoft System Center  create naming conventions to help automate this 
part of the inventory process.  
 Get help with manual reconciliation . Enlist your staff to help reconcile 
your development and test users with your dev elopment and test 
environment.  
 
Visual Studio Standard s ubscription 
administration for large teams and 
external c ontractors  
Visual Studio administrators are responsible for ensuring that each user who 
interacts with Visual Studio software is appropriately licensed with their own Visual 
Studio s ubscription.  
Internal teams  
Typical ly, modern software organizations include stakeholders from several groups. 
Identify contacts from each group who can help you keep track of user inventory  
and changes.  
Every organization is different, but a typical list of teams involved in development 
might include:  
 Software engineering teams.  
 Business teams, including product owners and business analysts.  
 Project management teams.  
 Quality teams, includ ing QA staff and manual testers.  
 IT operations, including pre -production and lab infrastructure managers.  
   
  6   |   Understanding Visual Studio Standard subscriptions ( MSDN Subscriptions ) 
External contractors and partners  
External contractors may bring licenses to engage with your Visual Studio -licensed 
environment. Microsoft Certified Partners may receive a number of free Visual 
Studio s ubscriptions for their internal use. However, these subscriptions do not 
cover revenue -generating activities such as developing custom software for a 
customer. Ask partners to send you a certified letter that explains the licenses they 
are providing and those that you need to procure.  
 
Track user assignment changes and 
process orders on schedule  
Visual Studio administrators are expected to track Visual Studio Sta ndard 
subscription usage and process orders for any increases in usage on the schedule 
outlined in their Microsoft Volume License Agreement.  
High watermark of usage  
Your company's obligation to purchase Visual Studio s ubscriptions takes effect 
immediately when:  
 A license is assigned to a user.  
 A user interacts with Visual Studio software.  
Your complete purchase obligation is determined by the high watermark of usage. 
This watermark is the high point either in daily user assignments or in users 
interacting w ith Visual Studio software, whichever is higher.  
1. Visual Studio administrators may increase the high watermark of usage by 
assigning Visual Studio s ubscriptions to individuals.  
2. Visual Studio administrators may reassign Visual Studio Standard subscriptions 
from one subscriber to another if 90 days have passed since the time of the 
original assignment. To avoid an artificially high watermark, always do this by 
removing the existing subscription before  adding the new one.  
3. Visual Studio administrators may change  the assigned subscription level for an 
individual, which would constitute a decrease in one assignment and an 
increase in another. When you lower a subscriber’s assigned subscription level, 
the individual must immediately stop using and uninstall anything  that is in the 
higher -level subscription.  
Open License and Open Value  
You may be assigning subscriptions through another Microsoft Volume Licensing 
program like Microsoft Open License or Open Value. If so, then you must process   
  7   |   Understanding Visual Studio Standard subscriptions ( MSDN Subscriptions ) 
your order for additional  users during the month in which users (employees or 
external contractors) begin interacting with Visual Studio -licensed software.  
Enterprise Agreements  
Microsoft Enterprise Agreements (EA) give you flexibility in how you use and license 
Visual Studio software over time. Visual Studio administrators must make an annual 
True-Up order to bring their software licenses up to the high watermark of usage 
established during the EA period.  
Microsoft Products and Services Agreement  
The Microsoft Products and Service  Agreement (MPSA) is a licensing agreement that 
provides a consolidated licensing agreement for all your software, online services, 
and Software Assurance purchases. MPSA replaces the Select Plus licensing program  
(retired July 1, 2015 ). Although n o new agreements can be created on Select Plus , 
you retain all licensing rights and Software Assurance coverage for the products 
purchased under your current Select Plus agreement .  
Customers with an MPSA agreement : 
 Must use t he Microsoft Volume Licensing Center  to manage their volume  
licensing.  
 Can still use the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)  to manage volume 
licensing under other Microsoft agreements . 
 Have access to a new portal for adminis tering Visual Studio Standard 
subscriptions.  
For additional information on understanding and managing Visual Studio Standard  
subscriptions under an MPSA, see the MPSA MSDN Administrator Guide .

Using the MSDN  Subscription  
Administration  portal 
The MSDN S ubscription  Administration  portal gives you a central location for 
managing your Visual Studio Standard subscriptions  (formerly MSDN Subscriptions)  
and allows you to:  
 Assign Visual Studio Standard s ubscriptions to your  organization’s  end users  
 Change benefit assignment  and contact information  
 View  summaries  of license and benefit assignments  
 Change Visual S tudio s ubscription levels for your users  
 Allocate, track, and manage  media assignments    
NOTE : The MSDN  Subscription  Administratio n portal is a section within the VLSC.  
Keep th is in mind when  you use the MSDN Subscription  Administration portal:  
 Visual Studio  subscriptions are licensed per user. Each subscriber can use 
the software on as many computers as needed for development and testing.  
 Leave all the component benefits (Subscriber Downloads, Technical 
Support incidents, Priority Support in MSDN Forums,  and MSDN Online 
Chat) selected when assigning a subscription. If you make Subscriber 
Downloads unavailable, subscribers cannot access the Visual Studio  
subscriptions portal. This will prevent them from downloading software or 
accessing e -learning, Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio Team Services , and 
other benefits that may be included with their subscription.  
 Assign only one subscription level for each subscriber, corresponding to 
the Visual Studio  subscription your organization purchased. If you have 
subscribers with more than one subscription level assigned to them, edit 
their settings so that they only have one.  
 A subscriber’s subscription level will need to be updated when the 
subscription is upgraded (after the purchase of a “step -up” license) or 
renewed at a lower level.  
 Do not share subscriptions between subscribers. You must assign a 
subscription to anyone who uses all or part of the subscription benefits 
(software for development and testing, Microsoft Azure, e -learning, etc.).
